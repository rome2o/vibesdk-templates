# Shopify Polaris template

This minimal template includes React + Vite + Shopify Polaris. It is intended as a starting point; you should expand it with real components, routing, and APIs as needed.

Polaris is standalone and does not require Tailwind. The template includes Polaris CSS imports and a basic `AppProvider` setup.

Packaging: follow existing repo conventions to produce a zip in `zips/` with the same name `shopify-polaris-runner.zip`.
